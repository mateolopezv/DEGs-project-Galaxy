# DEGs-project
This is a project for DEGs analysis where we start with a matrix of different counts and then we do some bioinformatics analysis to end up with DEGs. During this project, we made different plots to ilustrate those analysis.
This project was realized from https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html#analysis-of-the-differential-gene-expression. Here you will find all the information related to this RNAseq project with all the dataframes.
This project was made in "Galaxy"
